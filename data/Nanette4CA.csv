Maybe both should volunteer to serve federal workers to talk to some of the DHS employees I spoke to today who are struggling &amp; want government open. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/V8W2a8bUiz,Nanette4CA
243,2019-01-22 14:49:23+00:00,1087723910106361859,@TheToddSchulte @CNNSotu Thank you for your tireless work. We appreciate you.,Nanette4CA
244,2019-01-22 14:37:21+00:00,1087720879214206976,Great thread. Sunday on @CNNSotu I mentioned POTUS effectively moving towards a ban on asylum w/ proposal (I saw Admin turning asylum seekers away at POE Otay Mesa). Senate bill confirms - limits asylum &amp; endangers kids fleeing violence. Bad bill. POTUS misled Americans again. https://t.co/lwP2XJqmMq,Nanette4CA

As a member of @HomelandDems let‚Äôs invest in airports, seaports &amp; POE where the highest risks exist. End the shutdown and let‚Äôs give families the security of a paycheck. https://t.co/ECGF8CDipe",Nanette4CA
